# Infotainment-System
## Overview
Infotainment System applications developed using Dart and the Flutter SDK for integration into the Cadillac Lyriq as part of the UA EcoCAR project. Currently, the focus is on developing the Weather application, which provides real-time weather updates and forecasts. By the project's completion, the infotainment system will feature a total of nine applications.
